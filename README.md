# Maven Roaster Coffee-Shop-Sales
### Project Overview
Every coffee shop has a story hidden in its sales data. In this project, I used Power BI to uncover Maven Coffee Shop's. I dived into the data to understand the rhythms of the businessâ€”from its busiest days to its most profitable products. By transforming raw numbers into a clear visual narrative, this analysis reveals the key to the coffee shop's growth and provides a strategic guide for its future.I built an interactive dashboard to analyze sales trends, product performance, and store-level revenue. The goal was to transform raw data into a clear, strategic roadmap for increasing revenue and optimizing business operations.

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
#### Guiding Questions
The analysis was guided by a series of questions designed to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset. The key questions addressed were grouped by their relationship to the key findings.

- Which products are sold most and least often?
- How have Maven Roasters sales trended over time
- Which days of the week tend to be busiest, and why do you think that's the case
- What is the revenue by the order size
- What is the revenue generated by each store location and what is the total quantity sold.
- Which product category has the highest number of quantity sold.? Which drive the most revenue for the business

### Key Findings
- Brewed chai tea has the highest number of sold quantity with 26k followed by barister espresso coffee with 25k. while scone which is under the bakery category has the least sold item with 10k
- Upward Trend: "Maven Roasters' sales have shown a clear and consistent upward trend over the last six months. The line chart demonstrates a steady increase in revenue month-over-month, indicating strong growth and the effectiveness of recent business strategies
- Fridays is the busiest because For many people, Friday is a day for small celebrations and a feeling of relief. Customers might treat themselves to a more expensive, specialty drink they wouldn't get on a typical weekday. It's a way to decompress and transition from the work week to the weekend. This "treat yourself" mindset drives both higher foot traffic and larger individual orders.
- Small order has the highest revenue generated with $665k in total revenue with medium order with $29k and High order with $3.8k
- Hells Kitchen store generated $236k, Astoria $232k, Lower Mahattan $231k revenues respectively.
- The Coffee category are sold mostly and also drive the most revenue for the business

### Project Summary
This analysis of Maven Coffee Shop's sales data revealed a clear story of business performance and growth. Over the last six months, the business has experienced a strong upward trend in sales, with revenues peaking at $64k in June after starting the year at $31k in January. This growth is primarily driven by the Coffee product category, which accounts for the highest total quantity sold and overall revenue.

The analysis also identified key behavioral patterns, with Fridays consistently being the busiest day for sales, likely due to end-of-week rituals and social gatherings. The data further revealed that while individual small-sized orders generate the highest total revenue, top-performing products like Brewed Chai Tea and Barista Espresso Coffee are the business's main sales drivers.
From a location perspective, the Hells Kitchen store stands out as the top revenue generator. These insights provide a clear roadmap for strategic decision-making, from optimizing staffing on Fridays to leveraging the success of the Hells Kitchen location.



  ### Recommendations
Based on the findings from this analysis, here are four key recommendations to drive further business growth for Maven Coffee Shop.

#### Capitalize on Core Products and Categories:

Given that Coffee is the top-selling and highest-revenue category, it should be the central focus of marketing and product development.

Launch targeted promotions or a loyalty program specifically for Brewed Chai Tea and Barista Espresso Coffee to reward loyal customers and further boost sales of these top performers.

#### Optimize for Friday Sales:

Since Fridays are the busiest day, consider running a special "Friday Boost" or "Weekend Kickoff" promotion.

Strategically increase staff on Fridays to ensure quick service and a positive customer experience during peak hours.

#### Strategically Plan for Seasonal Trends:

Given the clear sales peaks in June and dips in January, the business should develop targeted seasonal strategies. This includes launching "Summer Specials" to capitalize on the high-revenue months and creating "Winter Warm-Up" promotions in January to drive foot traffic during the slower season.

#### Evaluate Store and Order Performance:

Investigate the operational and marketing strategies of the top-performing Hells Kitchen store to identify best practices that can be replicated at other locations.

Analyze the high volume of small orders to understand what drives their profitability. Look for opportunities to encourage customers to "upsell" to medium or large orders without alienating their core customer base.
