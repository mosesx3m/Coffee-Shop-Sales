# Coffee-Shop-Sales
### Project Overview
Every coffee shop has a story hidden in its sales data. In this project, I used Power BI to uncover Maven Coffee Shop's. I dived into the data to understand the rhythms of the businessâ€”from its busiest days to its most profitable products. By transforming raw numbers into a clear visual narrative, this analysis reveals the key to the coffee shop's growth and provides a strategic guide for its future.I built an interactive dashboard to analyze sales trends, product performance, and store-level revenue. The goal was to transform raw data into a clear, strategic roadmap for increasing revenue and optimizing business operations.
